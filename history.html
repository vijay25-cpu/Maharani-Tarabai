    <h3>Birth & Lineage</h3>

    <div class="flex-box">

      <div class="flex-text">
        <p>
          Tarabai was born into the illustrious Mohite clan. Her father Hambirrao Mohite,
        the Sar-Senapati of Shivaji Maharaj, was a legendary commander. Growing up in
        such a martial household, Tarabai imbibed the values of courage, discipline,
        and strategic thinking. She was trained in horse-riding, swordsmanship, and
        the art of governance, preparing her for the extraordinary role she would later play.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up in a military environment, she witnessed war meetings, strategies,
          and leadership from childhood. These experiences built courage, intelligence,
          and strength within her personality.

    <h3>Marriage to Rajaram</h3>

    <div class="flex-box reverse">
      <img src="court.jpeg">
      <div class="flex-text">
        <p>
         Tarabai’s marriage to Rajaram Bhosale was not merely a union of two royals,
        but a consolidation of Maratha power. She quickly proved herself as more than
        a queen consort—she became Rajaram’s advisor in matters of diplomacy and war.
        During Mughal invasions, she organized supplies, strengthened fort defenses,
        and inspired soldiers with her presence. Her wisdom in council and resilience
        in adversity made her indispensable to the Maratha throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          She stood beside Rajaram during times of war and learned administration,
          diplomacy, and fort defense. Her intelligence and bravery impressed
          many Maratha leaders.

    <h3>Regency & Resistance</h3>

    <div class="flex-box">
      <img src="tr.jpeg">
      <div class="flex-text">
        <p>
           After Rajaram’s death, Tarabai crowned her son Shivaji II and assumed regency.
        Unlike many queens of her era, she personally commanded armies and devised
        strategies against Aurangzeb. Her speeches rallied warriors, and her leadership
        ensured the Marathas survived one of their darkest periods. She became the
        embodiment of courage and defiance, proving that women could lead empires
        in times of crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          She personally led the resistance against the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb
          and showed exceptional leadership on the battlefield and in politics.

    <h3>Guerrilla Warfare</h3>

    <div class="flex-box reverse">
      <img src="attack.jpeg">
      <div class="flex-text">
        <p>
          Tarabai expanded Maratha attacks deep into Mughal territory using Ganimi Kava
        (guerrilla tactics). She disrupted supply chains, ambushed Mughal forces, and
        drained Aurangzeb’s empire of resources. Her campaigns forced the mighty Mughal
        emperor into frustration and exhaustion. Even Mughal chroniclers acknowledged
        her brilliance, calling her the “Mughal Nightmare.”
        </p>
        <p>
          She created fear in the Mughal army and forced Aurangzeb to struggle
          for years in the Deccan region.

  <div class="section">
    <span class="date">1710 – Kolhapur Throne</span>
    <h3>Foundation of Kolhapur</h3>

    <div class="flex-box">
      <img src="panhala.jpeg">
      <div class="flex-text">
        <p>
          After years of struggle, Tarabai established the Kolhapur princely state,
      securing sovereignty for her lineage. This move was not just political,
      but symbolic—it ensured that the Maratha legacy would remain divided yet
      strong. She reorganized administration, strengthened forts like Panhala,
      and maintained alliances with local sardars.
      </p>
      <p>Kolhapur became a center of
      Maratha resilience, balancing diplomacy with military might. Her vision
      safeguarded the future of her descendants and gave the Marathas a dual
      power structure that confused and weakened Mughal attempts at domination.

    <h3>Legacy of a Warrior Queen</h3>

    <div class="flex-box reverse">
      <img src="statue.jpeg">
      <div class="flex-text">
        <p>
           Tarabai lived until the age of 85, witnessing the Maratha Empire’s rise
      to its golden age. She had seen the empire survive Aurangzeb, expand under
      the Peshwas, and stand tall as a dominant power in India. Her legacy was
      not only military but cultural—she proved that women could lead empires,
      inspire armies, and shape history. Even in her later years, she remained
      a respected advisor, her words carrying weight in political councils.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, she is remembered as the flame that refused to be extinguished,
      the queen who turned resistance into victory, and the mother of Maratha
      resilience
